PPI file is first prepared using get_ppi.R code

Then the prepared PPI files (PPI old) is used to annotate unsupervised prediction: with annotate_feature matrix codes (there are three of them because I want to submit 3 separate jobs to the cluster)

The annotation result is further tidyed by the tidy_annotated_imp.R
After that, the output are imported in analysis.RMD for exploring and visualization.
