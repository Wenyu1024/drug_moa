PPI file is first prepared using get_ppi.R code

Then the prepared PPI files (PPI old) is used to annotate unsupervised prediction: with annotate_feature matrix codes (there are three of them because I want to submit 3 separate jobs to the cluster)

The annotation result is further tidyed by the tidy_annotated_imp.R
After that, the output are imported in analysis.RMD for exploring and visualization.

For pathway analysis, rank of the ess gene (raw value) is used for enrichment analysis.
Enrichment analysis is run on the server with get_pathway.sh  and pathway_enrichment.R
Then the output is further explored in Rmd, whereKEGG-GDSC result on mismatch repair is used for case study.
