# Gene essentiality signature for studying the mechanism of action of drugs

The lack of understanding of a drug's mechanism of action may prevent biomarker identification and ultimately lead to attrition in clinical trials.In this study, we explored whether the integration of loss-of-function genetic and drug sensitivity screening data could define a novel signature to better understand the mechanisms of action of drugs.

# Code and computing environment

Most analysis was conducted using CSC cloud server (cPouta) with RstudioServer and R 4.0.5, and should be easy to replicate. To replicate the analysis, load the files from the IO data folder and run the analysis .R or .Rmarkdown files in the corresponding subfolders. 

Heavy parallel computations were conducted using CSC HPC cluster, Puhti, where the R code, bash code and I/O data (described below) is provided.
