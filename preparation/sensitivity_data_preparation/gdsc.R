# I will run first on gdsc independently. 
# Do I have to run all the analysis on GDSC? perhaps first only do the sensitivity fitting.
# and then if the reviewer asked, do the rest.

# to run the analysis I need to map cell id. basically map Sanger_Model_ID to depmap_iD
# using the sample_info_broad.csv file
